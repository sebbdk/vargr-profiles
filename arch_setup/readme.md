 - Service/Performance check, are we running things we do not need????
    - Is there and app or list we can use to visualize this on a screen?

 - Play around with color and theme settings
 - Finish the theme configuration from diinki's video
 - Refine top bar, the icons are kinda weird
 - Attach a remote SSH session to current session
 - R&D firewall settings
 - More interesting login screen
